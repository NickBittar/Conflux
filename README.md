# Conflux
Problem:  When collaborating with many people in a group or team one will always attempt to schedule a time for everyone to meet up at.  Normally, the discussion while planning a time that is good for everyone is absolute chaos and noise and 
*"I am not available at that time on Thursdays"*s.

Conflux is my Meteor based solution to this uneccessary noise problem.

A user creates an event at a specified date range and receives two unique URLs. One is to send to other members of the team and the other
is to later view the results of all their members' availability nicely overlayed with one another's in a nicely digestible no-noise format.
